# Terraform Introduction (CORE)
**Duration: 2 days**

This training, proposed as a 2-day training, or 4 half-days, introduces students to the advantages of developing “Infrastructure as Code” with Terraform.

The intention is to follow this 2-day training with a separate 1-day training which applies the concepts learnt to the customers preferred Cloud Provider (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle) or other virtualized environment (Proxmox, OpenStack).

**Note:** These trainings are proposed as Terraform, but can equally be delivered as OpenTofu trainings

This initial 2-day training is the recommended way to learn Terraform basics:
  - It uses mainly Docker or local Providers for the base exercises
  - This allows to assimilate important Terraform concepts at an accelerated pace

Terraform allows to manage the deployment of different infrastructure types via the appropriate “Provider” plugin - this course uses the Docker provider to be able to experiment ten times faster than when using Cloud Providers or even Hypervisors.

Students will appreciate the ease with which infrastructure resources are defined in a declarative manner - using HCL v2 - “HashiCorp Configuration Language” - allowing resources to be created, updated or destroyed in an idempotent manner.

It is recommended to combine this 2-day training with one or more of the following 1-day Provider specific trainings:
