# CKAD exam preparation
**Duration: 1 day**

The objective of this single day training is to prepare to take the Linux Foundation “CKAD - Certified Kubernetes Application Developer” exam.
Participants should already have a first experience with the theory and practice of developing for  Kubernetes - having followed the “K8S-003-EN Development with Kubernetes” training for example or équivalent.
Participants will be challenged with various exam-like tasks to perform - see below for more details.
The training consists of about 90% hands-on labs.


# Training Outcomes

The training participant will be well prepared to take the certification


# Target Audience

This training is ideal for engineers who already have some experience with development for Kubernetes administration.
**Note:** Following K8S-003-EN & K8S-005-EN trainings alone is not sufficient to succeed in certification - much practice is necessary.   This training will provide tips, practical exercises and resources to help prepare for the exam.
Participants must provide their own PC with internet access, with the ability :
  - to use a browser to connect to sites hosted on AWS
  - to connect to AWS EC2 VMs using SSH
  - (an alternative connection method can be provided)


# Pre-requisites

To take full advantage of this training, participants :
  - should be at ease working at the command line
  - have basic notions of Linux processes
  - have basic notions of container engines such as Docker
  - Be able to use an SSH client such as openssh on Linux, macOS, WSL or Putty on Windows

If lacking command-line skills it is advised to first follow the training “LIN-001-EN - Introduction a Linux - en ligne de commande / shell” or equivalent.


# Evaluation

At the beginning of the training we will verify the domain experience, if any, and any expectations of each participant.


# Programme

During the day, participants will be challenged with practical tasks to accomplish similar to those encountered in the exam, for example :
  - Implement a scenario
  - a Deployment where the Pods access a ConfigMap mounted as a Volume
  - a DaemonSet where the Pods access a Secret via environment variables
  - prevent Pods in the ‘frontend’ Namespace ‘frontend’ being able to communicate with Pods in the ‘backend’ Namespace
  - Debug scenarios
  - Correct a Dockerfile
  - Make sure that best practices are adhered to for a Dockerfile
  - a Service which fails to respond to requests, or is intermittent
  - a Pod which fails to start, or a Container which continually restarts|
