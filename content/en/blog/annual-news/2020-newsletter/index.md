We're a bit late off the mark sending New Year's greetings due to

- last weeks Kubernetes training in Chile
- preparing a Kubernetes troubleshooting workshop for a conference (DevConf.cz, Brno) next week
- writing a Python script to send New Years' newsletters from HTML/markdown

	
## 2019

2019 proved to be an exciting first year of operations delivering

- trainings on Kubernetes, Docker and Terraform in Europe and in Chile.
- consulting on Kubernetes, Open Policy Agent

There were some conference workshops, presentations on Serverless, Micro-services and Kubernetes Troubleshooting.
A huge thanks to the partners, customers and colleagues who made those opportunities possible.
