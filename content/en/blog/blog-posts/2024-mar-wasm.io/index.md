Last week, I attended the 2nd Wasm I/O conference in Barcelona, 2 hours from our base. I've dabbled with WebAssembly but the time is right to dive deeper into this emerging technology. Wasm I/O is a nice human sized conference facilitating networking & knowledge exchange. Despite the scarcity of container officionados, the presence of industry stalwarts like Nigel Poulton & Saiyam Pathak from the Kubernetes realm allowed insightful conversations.

The conference left me convinced that the WebAssembly domain is on the cusp of a breakthrough, poised to revolutionize cloud computing, AI but also niche sectors like embedded systems & IoT. It feels akin to a puzzle nearing completion, with just a few pieces left to place for the full picture to emerge. In a future post, I'll share insights from KubeConEU in Paris, where WebAssembly's integration was notably significant.

Highlights from Wasm I/O included groundbreaking talks & workshops, especially those focusing on leveraging Wasm on small devices. The potential for secure application execution across various platforms, from desktops to the smallest IoT devices, is immense. A standout session was by Gapfruit, a Swiss company specializing in Industrial IoT, which showcased their commitment to creating secure computing systems. Their approach to safeguarding applications from external threats was particularly compelling, indicating a serious dedication to advancing secure computing.

The conference also featured innovative uses of AI, such as Midokura's (Sony) discussion on embedding AI in webcams for efficient data processing reducing the need to transfer vast amounts of raw data.

Exploring the Wasmer ecosystem's offerings – from compilers to runtime environments and artifact registries – was another highlight.

John de Goes' of Golem Cloud showed a model for distributing requests across nodes to achieve resilience, reminiscent of the Raft consensus protocol. 

Microsoft's demonstrated Wasm debugging in VS Code - but I felt there was so much more that they could have said about their Wasm investments.

Looking ahead, I'm eager to experiment with various tools & cloud solutions like Wasmer Cloud & Fermyon Cloud, or as a Kubernetes trainer, I'm particularly excited about SpinKube, or Wasm on Raspberry Pi.

I currently don't offer WebAssembly training, but plans are underway to develop courses in this area.

Lastly, as KubeCon week progresses, I'm pleased to announce our upcoming "Kubernetes Admin" online training sessions scheduled for April through July, now open for registration with a special 15% discount to celebrate KubeCon week.

The first monthly cohorts will be 9h-17h Paris time, from Monday 8th to Thursday 11th April.

If you're attending Rejekts.io or KubeCon, do say hello!
I look forward to sharing my experiences from both events soon.
