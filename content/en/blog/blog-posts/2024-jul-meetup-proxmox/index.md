## Details
Are you passionate about virtualization and looking for a powerful alternative to VMWare? Join us for our next Meetup on Proxmox, the essential open source solution that manages both the Linux KVM hypervisor and Linux Containers (LXC)!

#### Why Proxmox ?
Proxmox is widely deployed in enterprises and appreciated by amateurs for its ability to efficiently manage virtual machines. With the recent licensing changes of VMWare since its acquisition by Broadcom, the interest in Proxmox has never been greater.

#### What you will discover:
- 🔧 Use via the console (webUI): Discover how Proxmox simplifies the management of VMs with an intuitive interface.
- 💻 Command line tools (qm and others): Explore the powerful CLI tools for fine-grained and automated management.
- 🚀 Infra as Code with Terraform, Pulumi, ClusterAPI: Learn how to integrate Proxmox into your Infrastructure as Code workflows for smooth and repeatable deployments.
- 🌀 Nested Proxmox in Proxmox: Push the boundaries of virtualization by exploring advanced configurations with nested Proxmox.
